However, a distinct downtick in physical touch and face-to-face interaction mark the age of the Computer, the Web, and the People, ultimate ingredients in the BUGNET sandwich. <br/><br/>There is no time in which the BUGNET was &#x27; Founded &#x27;. It was only &#x27; Coined &#x27;. BUGNET&#x27;s progenitors were not masterminds of intranet communication like We are. They only talked. And talked and Talked until Talking didn&#x27;t satisfy their hunger for a larger sandwich. <br/><br/>The first piece &#x27; shared &#x27; piece of art was a photo of BC&#x27;s skyline.<br/><br/>This caramelized onion of a post was followed by another angle, from another bug. We begin to establish a Zone.<br/><br/>Erase that last word from your memory. &#x27; Zone &#x27; is fallacious. BUGNET is a nation without borders. <br/><br/>The sandwich grows yummier. SURFCLUB appears from the newfound sugary onions of the net. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m here for. This is what we found BCLF on. This basis. And these users. <br/><br/>And BUG thinks this is silly. Bugs can&#x27;t live on the web, obviously. They&#x27;re not made for it. <br/><br/><strong>FUTURE</strong><br/><br/>But they can be &#x27; <strong>Made </strong>&#x27; for other things, apparently.<br/><br/></p></div><div id="w-node-_065c8e61-d9d9-3c7c-3258-53082547ab03-2d87d2fe" class="w-layout-cell"></div></div></div></div><div class="w-layout-blockcontainer container-3 w-container"><div class="w-layout-blockcontainer container-4 w-container"><div id="w-node-c8f96d28-54ff-bb4b-512b-0536595451ae-2d87d2fe" class="w-layout-layout quick-stack-2 wf-layout-layout"><div id="w-node-c8f96d28-54ff-bb4b-512b-0536595451af-2d87d2fe" class="w-layout-cell"><div class="text-block-2"><em>4 - 5 - 94 - DOI : 8H</em></div><h1 class="heading-2">on <em>BUG</em></h1><div class="text-block-3">PACKHORSE</div></div><div id="w-node-c8f96d28-54ff-bb4b-512b-0536595451b9-2d87d2fe" class="w-layout-cell"></div><div id="w-node-c8f96d28-54ff-bb4b-512b-0536595451ba-2d87d2fe" class="w-layout-cell"><p class="paragraph"><strong>&#x27;bug unification group&#x27;<br/><br/></strong>unfortunately, <em>BUG </em>is in the public eye again.<br/><br/>i should rephrase - it&#x27;s good that <em>BUG </em>is getting attention, the difficult part is that they&#x27;re doing fine.<br/><br/>their presence in bc started humbly (ha) in small biotech circles, and through a wave of calculated &#x27;risks&#x27;, business shenanigans, and eventual corporate buyouts, they grew to become the plague on society we know today. a real inspiring story, i know.<br/><br/>but what do they DO? the average person certainly doesn&#x27;t know. in fact, i&#x27;d argue that before we started leaking, the median BUGNET user couldn&#x27;t even articulate what they did. they could, however, tell you that they were anti-art, which is a better summation than what the common bug could pull out of their ass<br/><br/>beyond the (relatively) blatant anti-BUGNET stuff, their transarthropodist (ugh) undertones were present from their inception through prosthesis r&amp;d, so that&#x27;s one thing. doesn&#x27;t take a genius to figure out they want to rip out your limbs. the nuance comes from the fact that maybe your limbs are good actually, and perhaps being a weirdo cyborg isn&#x27;t ideal!<br/><br/><strong>future<br/><br/></strong>the best thing i can say about <em>BUG</em> is that their biggest fans are people who you will never ever have to interact with on a personal level. the general populus doesn&#x27;t give a shit, which is pretty funny.<br/><br/>it was just a few weeks ago we leaked the images. their geolocation protocols mean we can&#x27;t really post those here, but they&#x27;re still floating around if you&#x27;re still interested (and you should be!!!). this is the actual worrying content. a future in which people THINK they know what <em>BUG </em>is up to. we&#x27;re keepin it real tho <br/><br/>i&#x27;m still uncovering stuff. there&#x27;s some cool tools we&#x27;re working on. i have a pet project that&#x27;s coming in handy<br/><br/>if you know something that we should know too, mail us or contact me thru SURFCLUB<br/>‍<br/>𐂃<br/><br/></p></div><div id="w-node-c8f96d28-54ff-bb4b-512b-0536595451ef-2d87d2fe" class="w-layout-cell"></div></div></div></div><div class="w-layout-blockcontainer container-3 w-container"><div class="w-layout-blockcontainer container-4 w-container"><div id="w-node-_26ce8428-4242-29c1-3bf5-4e902b6e8672-2d87d2fe" class="w-layout-layout quick-stack-2 wf-layout-layout"><div id="w-node-_26ce8428-4242-29c1-3bf5-4e902b6e8673-2d87d2fe" class="w-layout-cell"><div class="text-block-2"><em>4 - 5 - 92 - DOI : 8H</em></div><h1 class="heading-2">Welcome to bugcityliberationforce.org</h1><div class="text-block-3">BCLF STAFF</div></div><div id="w-node-_26ce8428-4242-29c1-3bf5-4e902b6e867b-2d87d2fe" class="w-layout-cell"></div><div id="w-node-_26ce8428-4242-29c1-3bf5-4e902b6e867c-2d87d2fe" class="w-layout-cell"><p class="paragraph"><strong>WELCOME<br/></strong><br/>Welcome to bugcityliberationforce.org, BCLF&#x27;s official website.<br/><br/>Currently, access to this website is restricted to approved users on the BUGNET and registered SURFLUB members.<br/><br/>We&#x27;re looking to expand our reach.
